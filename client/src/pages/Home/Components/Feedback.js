        "We had a delicious dinner tonight and had a really great time.Food was authentic and came out quite quickly. The goat curry was particularly yummy, just be careful of the few bones in there. Rice was done perfectly too.A huge shout out to our server Mahalia who was very polite, fun and attentive. Will definitely be back again!",
